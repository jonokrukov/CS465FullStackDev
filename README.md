# CS465 Full Stack Development Travlr Getaways Web Application README Reflection

**Architecture**

In developing the Travlr Getaways web application, I worked with multiple technologies that include Angular and Express.js, each conferring their own unique benefit to the project. My backend framework utilizes Express.js, which is a lightweight solution that handles server-side operations and manages API endpoints the front end can then access. The middleware capabilities provided by Express.js also enabled me to easily handle HTTP requests and implement hash-protected password authentication. Angular allowed me to convert the original, outdated front end of the Travlr Getaways application into a dynamic, single-page application (SPA) that utilizes a modular, component-based structure. This conversion made the app much more responsive and interactive, although it introduced some challenges with complex debugging. With regard to a database solution, my backend utilizes a NoSQL MongoDB database due to its document-oriented structure. This is a perfect fit for this project because it makes it easier to handle dynamic and complex data, such as travel plans and user profiles, and was a deciding factor in choosing MongoDB. The ability to use Mongoose object modeling to create schemas for data structuring and organization was another factor in choosing MongoDB as a database solution. 

**Functionality**

The JSON file format was crucial in tying together both the front end and back end of the Travlr Getaways web application. While JavaScript provides the logic that runs the application, JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, serves as a format for structuring data and transferring data. Angular's front end sends data formatted in JSON to the back end, where Express.js can process it and interact with the MongoDB database through Mongoose. The back end can then return JSON responses that ensure the transferred data has remained consistent and easily interpretable across every layer. In terms of refactoring parts of the codebase to improve functionality and efficiency, I built reusable components for listing and showcasing trips, adding trips, and editing trips. These components made the front end much more modular and easier to maintain and develop new features for in the future. Much of the original back end was reworked to operate through the utilization of routers and controllers to manage the application's routing logic and its request handling. 

**Testing**

In the Travlr Getaways web application, RESTful API endpoints were an essential part in managing data flow between the front end, back end, and database. By utilizing methods like GET, POST, and PUT, I was able to implement the functionality for retrieving, creating, and updating trips and registering and authenticating users. Express.js handled the routing for these interactions, while Mongoose facilitated interaction with the MongoDB database. Testing these endpoints involved the use of tools like Postman and MongoDB Compass to validate requests and verify the data was being modified as intended. Security testing is adding much more complexity due to the fact that password hashing, token-based authentication, and access control for protected routes were all things I implemented. Overall, these efforts were a key part in creating a secure and reliable application. 

**Reflection**

This course has been instrumental in helping me grow as a developer and has significantly advanced my skills and confidence in software development as I work towards a professional career. Through building the Travlr Getaways web application, I was able to gain practical, hands-on experience with the MEAN stack and learn how to develop scalable and dynamic applications. I was also able to improve my understanding of integrating front end and back end components, creating secure and stable RESTful APIs, and managing NoSQL databases with MongoDB and Mongoose. Refactoring the original, outdated application taught me the importance of writing clean, modular code and ensuring that secure coding practices are utilized where possible to protect both user and system data.
